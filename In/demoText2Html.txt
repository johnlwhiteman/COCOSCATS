CS 6460: Educational Technology will be a heavily project-based class in which students will deeply investigate the tools, methods, and theories behind educational technology; demonstrate mastery of a subset of the field; propose either implementing a tool for or conducting research in educational technology; and deliver a final project along with a presentation and publication-ready paper.  

Just as the on-campus course has no lectures, so also the online course will not be lecture-based; instead, the course will be based on a curated library of materials, such as academic publications, media articles, existing tools, past projects, original interviews with experts in the field. Students in the class will navigate and investigate the topics most pertinent to their interests and project ideas, as well as contribute to the library for future classes. As part of this, TAs, acting more as mentors, will work closely with small groups of students to develop their understanding and ideas, scope their plans, and deliver a final project.

The ultimate goal is that these projects will lead to academic publications, start-up businesses, ongoing research projects, or tools to use in the OMSCS program.

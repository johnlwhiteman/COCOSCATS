The Crocodile and the Monkey

Buaya the crocodile lived a pleasant life. The river was large, its sand banks were comfortable for basking in the sun, and a palm tree with his favorite coconuts grew on those banks. Every day he had a short distance to swim in order to do everything he liked doing.

With noisy chatter and squeals, Beruk climbed to the top of the coconut tree and promptly placed every riped coconut and ate all of them. Observing this from below, Buaya became angry. "All my coconuts!" he muttered. "That monkey is eating them. There won't be any food left for me. I must stop him. But how?

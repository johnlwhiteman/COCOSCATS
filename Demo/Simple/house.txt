I live in a two-story, green house. We bought it twenty years ago. It has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen and living room. The windows are clean, but the two-car garage is dirty. The neighbors are nice, but their dogs bark too much. I have to mow the lawn every week. The dogs like to pee on the green grass making it yellow. We renovated the kitchen last month. It has a sink, refrigerator, oven and stove. The mortgage is affordable. The property taxes and insurance are too high though. My kids grew up in this house. They left home for college a few years ago. Now we live by ourselves in the house. We lock the doors every night.
